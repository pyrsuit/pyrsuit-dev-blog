        "text": "Today I learned how much I enjoy using `uv` scripts for quick, one-off tasks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can define dependencies right at the top of the script, and when you run it with `uv`, it spins up a temporary virtual environment automatically. Once the script finishes, the environment is destroyed â€” super clean ðŸ§¹\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is perfect for things like initial tasks when starting a container, or scripts that import data, run a migration, or do any kind of setup that isn't needed once the main app is running.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nðŸ’¡ **Takeaway**: __[uv scripts](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/)__ give you a disposable, isolated environment without any manual setup â€” ideal for clean, repeatable scripting without leaving a mess behind."

        "text": "I recently deployed an API using `uWSGI` with multiple workers. I exposed a `/metrics` endpoint for `Prometheus` scraping â€” all looked good.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUntil I realizedâ€¦ the metrics were off ðŸ« \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTurns out, when you're using multiple `uWSGI` workers, `Prometheus`' Python client needs **multiprocess mode** enabled to aggregate metrics across all worker processes. Without it, each process exposes its own separate metrics â€” so counters, for example, appear to jump up and down instead of increasing cumulatively across all workers. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nâœ… **Fix:** Configured __[multiprocess mode](https://prometheus.github.io/client_python/multiprocess/)__, so all workers write metrics to a shared directory.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nðŸ’¡ **Takeaway**: With multiple workers per replica, `Prometheus` scrapes the `/metrics` endpoint from only one worker per replica at random â€” so without multiprocess mode, your `Prometheus` metrics won't reflect the true state of your API â€” making it impossible to accurately track what's really happening."
